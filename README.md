<h1 align="center" > Hey! I'm Lav√≠nia üòÅ </h1>

### About me ‚ú®

- **My full name is:** Lav√≠nia Franciscatto
- **And I'm a:** 20-year-old girl
- **You can also call me:** Lavs
- **I'm from:** Brazil
- **And I love to**: Study everything (I'm a very curious person), read police dramas, play video games, watch sitcoms, and exercise!
- **Here's about my education:**
     - I'm a fifth-semester Computer Science student at Universidade Paulista (UNIP).
     - I have completed [Harvard's introductory computer science course CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science)
 
### What I have been doing... ‚ú®

- I'm a trainee developer at a technology company called ITIX, located in Brazil. I am part of an international team, and we are responsible for the unified platform of a multinational company.

### Some curiosities about me ‚ú®

- I had my first experience with programming two years ago, and since then, I've been falling in love with this world every day!
- I've always been a studious person, so I love exploring new programming concepts!
- One of my biggest professional goals is to become an excellent developer, delivering amazing projects and satisfying my clients!
- My focus is to become a FullStack developer, but in my spare time, I love creating designs!

### Professional Highlight ‚ú®

- I have always been passionate about writing and reading, and since I have a natural aptitude for it, I decided to incorporate it into my profession. I have written three articles for the company where I work, all using a developer-friendly and didactic language. The first article I wrote was *How to create a new MFE project on an NX repository*, and it‚Äôs important to highlight that it was a highly requested piece of documentation. The other two topics I have written about are:
- *How to create Dynamic Forms*
- *Generic Component - its importance and how to create one*
